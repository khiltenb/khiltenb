Hello! My name is Ken Hiltenbrand, and I go by @khiltenb here on GitHub.
I use this site for many personal projects and a select few school projects.
I'm currently trying to brush up on Python, C++, and PHP as well as skills with SQL, HTML and CSS.
I'm trying to learn (among other languages) JavaScript, Java, and how to use some pieces of hardware like Arduino.
The best way to reach me is my email:  kenhiltenbrand@gmail.com
