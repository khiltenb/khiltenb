Hello! My name is Ken Hiltenbrand, and I go by @khiltenb here on GitHub.

I use this site for both personal projects and learning new skills.

I mainly program in C/C++, but I also either currently work with or have worked with python and javascript.

I'm currently trying to learn ada, haskell, fortran, and rust but the list grows the more I learn in the industry.

If you like anything you see in my repos and want to work on it with me, the best way to reach me is my email:  kenhiltenbrand@gmail.com
